# Crucial Data Structures & Algorithms for Technical Interviews

Author: Kihoon Lee (Computer Science Student at University of Washington-Seattle)

Crucial Data Structures & Algorithms for Technical Interviews is a great resource to prepare coding interviews.

This REPO includes but no limited to fundamental and advanced algorithms, data structures, and technical question patterns.
